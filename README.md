# Java-Dungeon-Game
This is a dungeon minigame in which the user can move around a map collecting gold in order to win.

The main requisite for completing on of my coursework was implementing the minigame, however; I was eager to attempt the additional challenges.

### Features
- The user can choose to play the maps that they have created by entering their file path.
- There is a **bot player** that attempts to catch the user.
### Game Instructions
The user can perform the following commands:
- Move X where X is direction, ie N for north, S, E, W. 
- Look, the program outputs a 5x5 array (see screenshots) with the player at its centre and the players surroundings
